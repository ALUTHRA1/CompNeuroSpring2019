Computational Tools and Data Analysis for Neuroscience Spring 2019

## Course Objective
Like many other fields that rely on statistical analyses to understand complex systems, it is the case for neuroscience that the tools needed to analyze and interpret data sets ever increasing in richness and size include interfacing with your data via code. In this course you will learn how to program as well as gain a sense of the available resources and options for scientific computing. To begin, you will use the MATLAB environment. However, many of the concepts learned there can be readily applied to other programming lanuages such as Python, R, Julia or C/C++, some of the pros and cons of which will be discussed, and possibly explored. Learning will largely be hands on, and will include working with any or all of the following as time permits: plotting and data visualization, probability distributions, differential equations, timeseries, fourier analysis, wavelets, Markov models, optimization, clustering, image analysis, machine and deep learning. Although not a prerequisite, you will invariably use linear algebra and calculus, which I will introduce as needed. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to provide you a basic computational toolset in order to provide a platform on which you can build your own custom analyses for large or complex data sets that are becoming more and more ubuquitous in modern neuroscience.
