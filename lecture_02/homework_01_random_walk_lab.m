% - writing scripts
% - coding good practices
% - practice manipulating and visualizing multi-dimensional data arrays

%% 1. Random walk in one dimension.
% Write a program simulating a one-dimensional random walk amongst 100
% discrete sites with the random walker having equal probability to step in
% either direction at each time step. Treat the edges as reflecting (i.e.
% the walker steps back the other direction with 100% probability). Start
% 1000 independent walkers distributed uniformly at sites 11-15 and observe
% how they distribute as time progresses. Make the probability of going
% left-vs-right a variable in the program so that you can play around with
% it. Use plots to visually convey what is going on.


%% 2. Random walk in two dimensions.
% Write a program simulating a two-dimensional random walk amongst 30x30
% discrete sites with 1000 independent walkers initially distributed
% uniformly at sites 11-12 in each dimension with 25% probability to step
% in each direction and reflecting boundaries. Use plots to visually convey
% what is going on.


%% 3. Random walk in one dimension.
% Same as #1, but make the probability of going left-vs-right unequal, and
% also make it so that the left-vs-right probability swaps every time a
% walker reflects off of a boundary.


%% 4. Random walk in two dimensions.
% Same as #2, but make the probabilities of going in each direction unequal
% and make it so that moving off of one edge wraps around to the opposite
% edge.


%% 5. Random walk in three dimensions.
% Write a program simulating a three-dimensional random walk amongst
% 30x30x30 discrete sites with 1000 independent walkers initially
% distributed uniformly at sites 11-12 in each dimension with equal
% probability to step in each direction and boundaries that wrap to the
% opposite side. Use plots to visually convey what is going on.


%% 6. Random walk in three dimensions.
% Write a program simulating a three-dimensional random walk in a
% continuous space. Let 1000 independent walkers all start at random
% positions within a cube with corners at (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). At each time
% step each walker will move in a random direction by a random amount
% between 0-0.1. Use plots to visually convey what is going on.
